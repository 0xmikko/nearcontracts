### Inspiration
Near protocol looks much friendly than other blockchains, especially in onboarding process. My goal is to make it more popular and practical usage. Simpilifed login & signup flow makes Near protocol very promising for real adoption.

### Problem

Majority of people are know nothing about smart contracts. Only tech-savvy people could understand them pretty well. However, with current ecomonic turmoil and lack of trust, we need someting better that regular contracts especially to work with foreign partnets.

### Solution

NearContacts allows you to write your contract using markdown language and create and use special symbols to add smartcontracts functionality. So, you could simply copy your existing contract and convert it into smart contract with a few clicks!

Smartconttracts works well, however, both sides would have real contract which provided additional law protection!
