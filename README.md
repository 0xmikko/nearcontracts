# NearContracts
Make Smartcontracts more popluar!

### Inspiration
Near protocol looks much friendly than other blockchains, especially in onboarding process. My goal is to make it more popular and practical usage.

With NearContacts you could simply write your contract with markdown and use special symbols to add smartcontracts functionality. So, you could simply copy your existing contract and convert it into smart contract with a few clicks!

Smartconttracts works well, however, both sides would have real contract which provided additional law protection!
